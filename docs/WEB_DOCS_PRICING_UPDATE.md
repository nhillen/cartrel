# Web Docs & Pricing Update Plan

**Goal**  
Align public-facing website/docs/pricing with the revised feature set, naming, and competitive positioning (vs Syncio, Multi Store Sync Power).

## Naming & Messaging Changes
- “Order Push/Add-on” → “Order Forwarding” (with Shadow Preview).
- “Product Settings Add-on” → “Catalog Field Controls.”
- “Metafields Add-on” → “Metafields Sync.”
- “Universal Store” → “Dual-Role Mode with Re-share Consent.”
- Emphasize “Partner Network” (Marketplace) not “Marketplace” if we prefer differentiation.
- Clarify POS/local pickup limitations and bundle compatibility caveats.
- Flag roadmap items as “coming soon”: collection sync, price rules/markups, extended metafields (collections/reference), auto support for Shopify “On Hold” orders, per-connection billing option.

## Website Sections to Update
- **Homepage/Features:** highlight modes (Inventory+Catalog vs Catalog-only), order forwarding, catalog controls, metafields sync caps, payouts, dual-role, partner network, rate-limit resilience.
- **Pricing Page:** reflect new tier caps, bundled features (order forwarding, catalog controls, starter metafields, payouts), generous free tier (150 products, 10 pushes), meta caps per tier, re-share/marketplace in Growth/Scale; optional per-connection pricing (flag as coming soon/enterprise).
- **FAQs/Support:** update triggers, POS/local pickup limitation, $0 order workaround, on-hold order handling, hidden tag behavior, auto-add variants only, no auto product creation, collection sync/price rules as roadmap.
- **Competitive Comparison:** call out single-sided billing, higher free caps, bundled features vs add-ons, re-share consent, partner network, price rules/collection sync roadmap.
- **Developer/Changelog:** note upcoming roadmap items (collection sync, price rules, extended metafields, on-hold auto support).
- **Product Offering Page:** clearly separate “Available now” vs “Coming soon” (collection sync, price rules, extended metafields, auto on-hold support, per-connection billing) with brief descriptions to set expectations and capture interest.

## Pricing Table (public) Adjustments
- Free: 3 connections; 150 products; 10 order forwards (manual); basic catalog fields; inventory sync; metafields 10 defs; payouts included; no auto forwarding.
- Starter/Core/Pro/Growth/Scale: reflect caps per PRD_PRICING_PACKAGING; bundle order forwarding, catalog controls, payouts; meta caps; re-share/partner network in Growth/Scale; collection/price rules marked “coming soon.”
- Note optional per-connection billing for partner network/marketplace as “contact us.”

## Assets/Docs to Touch
- Website pricing page.
- Features/overview page.
- FAQs (inventory triggers, POS, bundles, hidden tags, refunds, collections roadmap).
- In-app help links to updated docs/PRDs as appropriate.

## Timing/Owners
- Content draft → review → publish alongside product toggles (free tier caps, auto/manual forwarding default).
