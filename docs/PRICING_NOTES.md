# Pricing Model Notes

## Per-Connection Billing for Dropselling (TODO)

**Problem:** Suppliers might want to enable dropselling (letting retailers list and sell their products), but don't want to pay for connections that aren't producing sales.

**Proposed Solution:** Per-store/per-connection billing option
- More expensive than using built-in plan licenses (bundled connections)
- Gives suppliers flexibility to pay-as-you-go for dropselling relationships
- Incentivizes the bundled plan approach for committed relationships
- Allows testing new retailers without committing to a plan upgrade

**Example pricing consideration:**
- Plan includes X connections at $Y/month
- Additional per-connection: $Z/month (where Z > Y/X to make bundles attractive)

**Use cases:**
1. Supplier wants to test a new retailer before committing
2. Seasonal retailers that only sell during certain periods
3. Low-volume stockists where a full connection isn't justified
4. Marketplace-style setups with many small retailers

**Status:** Not yet implemented. Revisit when building out marketplace billing features.
