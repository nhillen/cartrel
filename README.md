# Cartrel

Direct wholesale rails for Shopify stores.

## What is Cartrel?

Cartrel connects Shopify brands with their retail stockists through automated product sync, wholesale terms, and clean purchase order workflows—without acting as a marketplace or owning the relationship.

### The Problem

- Faire charges high commissions and owns the customer relationship
- Manual wholesale processes use spreadsheets, PDFs, and email chains
- Inventory and pricing constantly falls out of sync
- No good way to manage tiered pricing or wholesale perks

### The Solution

Cartrel provides **infrastructure, not a marketplace**:

✅ Direct Shopify-to-Shopify product sync
✅ Automated wholesale catalog management
✅ Clean purchase order workflows
✅ Configurable payment terms (prepay, NET 30/60, etc.)
✅ Tier-based pricing and automated perks
✅ Full relationship ownership - no commission on repeat orders

## Core Value Props
